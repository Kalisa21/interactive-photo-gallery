# Interactive Photo Gallery

This project is a simple interactive photo gallery with hover effects and details displayed on mouseover. 

## Getting Started

1. **Download:** Download the project files.
2. **Open index.html:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Testing the Coding Challenges

1. **Open DevTools:**  Open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12).
2. **Run the challenges:** In the console, type `node arrayMap.js` and `node stringTransform.js` to see the output.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for interactivity.
- `images/`: Folder containing image files.
- `arrayMap.js`: Coding challenge for array manipulation.
- `stringTransform.js`: Coding challenge for string transformations.

## Approach

**Photo Gallery:**

- The gallery uses flexbox for layout and responsive design.
- Hover effects are implemented using CSS transitions.
- JavaScript is used to display image details dynamically on hover.

**Coding Challenges:**

- **Array Manipulation:** The `hasSubarrayWithSum()` function uses a sliding window approach to efficiently check if a subarray sum exists.
- **String Transformation:** The `transformString()` function utilizes string manipulation methods and conditional logic to apply the specified transformations.
