Interactive Photo Gallery
This project implements an interactive photo gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The gallery displays images with a hover effect that shows additional information about each image.

Features
Responsive design: The gallery adapts to different screen sizes.
Hover effect: When hovering over an image, the details (title, description, and location) are displayed in a separate section.
Customizable image data: You can easily change the images and information by modifying the data attributes in the HTML.
Files
index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the gallery.
style.css: The CSS file responsible for styling the gallery elements.
script.js: The JavaScript file that handles the hover effect and dynamically updates the image details.
images: A folder containing the images used in the gallery.
Instructions
Download the code: Download the zip file containing the project files from [Link to GitHub Repository].
Open in browser: Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Explore the gallery: Hover over the images to see their details.
Customization
Images: Replace the sample images with your own by updating the src attribute in the image tags in index.html.
Image details: Update the data-title, data-description, and data-location attributes for each image to change the information displayed on hover.
Styling: Adjust the CSS in style.css to customize the look and feel of the gallery according to your preferences.
Coding Challenges
The repository also includes two JavaScript coding challenges:

arrayMap.js: This challenge involves determining if a subarray in a given array sums to a specified target value.
stringTransform.js: This challenge transforms a string based on its length and its divisibility by 3, 5, and 15.
