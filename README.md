Coding Challenges
Challenge 1: Array Manipulation
Problem Statement: Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.

Solution: The hasContiguousSubarray function in Challenges/arrayMap.js provides the solution.

Challenge 2: String Transformation
Problem Statement: Given a string, transform it based on the following rules:

If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the order specified above.
Solution: The transformString function in Challenges/stringTransform.js provides the solution.
